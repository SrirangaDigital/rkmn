					<p>Srimat Swami Shivanandaji Maharaj, the second President of the Ramakrishna Order during his first visit to Nagpur in the month of February 1925, sowed the seed for starting a center of the Ramakrishna Order. This seed had sprouted with the donation of a big plot of land in Dhantoli (Craddock town) and also with the beginning of worship of Sri Ramakrishna in a humble hut built on this land with clay walls.</p>
					<p>The hut, which then existed in the ashrama site, served as a temple, a dispensary, and also his living space. Towards the end of the year 1929, he could start the construction of the main building of the Ashrama and it was ready for use in the year 1932. This new building initially housed the shrine for the worship of Sri Ramakrishna, a public library, a dispensary and all other appurtenant uses of the ashram.</p>
